#research question: does male female buyer rations are similar across region

#H0: male female buyer proportion is same across the region
#Ha: male female buyer proportion are different across the region
#since it has more than 2 proportion comparision so we will use chai square test
# import libraries into current session

#it will convert stacked data into table formulate on which we can apply chi square test

#if i apply above code it will change the count value which may give slight change  in p-value=0.2931 
#with error massage"Warning message:In chisq.test(table(stack_info)) :Chi-squared approximation may be
#incorrect"
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#so chisq.test() do not take character value of table it takes only numerical value so we need to
#remove column containing male female

#p-value is 0.6603 which accept null hypothesis 
#we can conclude that male-female buyer proportion is same across regions
